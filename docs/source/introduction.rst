Introduction
============

Open Bank Project is an open source API for banks that provides a RESTful interface for developers to build customer facing applications without needing to code for each bank or account type differently.

What sort of applications can I build with the Open Bank Project API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Customer facing retail banking and fintech applications for consumers, SMEs, associations, charities, governments and NGOs etc
- Personal Finance Management (PFM) Solutions
- Online accounting integrations
- Financial widgets, Savings Apps, Education Apps, Gamification 
- Peace of Mind Apps, Transparency Apps, Crowd funding, on boarding, CRM etc..

What data and services can I access?
------------------------------------

An Open Bank Project instance can contain simulated customer related data. With real bank integrations, this can be real account data.


APIs include
-----------------------------------------------

- Account information, balance and transaction history of multiple bank accounts
- Initiate payments
- Onboard Customers (KYC etc.)
- Enrich bank transactions with metadata (tags, comments, urls and geolocation) for example to link a receipt or video to a transaction
- Create/Access different views on accounts. Each view grants a subset of the data to a restricted group of users. For example, a customer could offer special views on his account to his accountants, auditors or regulators. A charity might open their accounts to the public
