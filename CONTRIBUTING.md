# Contributing


## Hello!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Open Bank Project!

## Pull requests

If submitting a pull request please read and sign our [CLA](http://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/blob/develop/Harmony_Individual_Contributor_Assignment_Agreement.txt) and send it to contact@tesobe.com - We'll send you back a code to include in the comment section of subsequent pull requests.

Please reference Issue Numbers in your commits.

## Code comments

Please comment your code ! :-) Imagine an engineer is trying to fix a production issue: she is working on a tiny screen, via a dodgy mobile Internet connection, in a sandstorm - Your code is fresh in your mind. Your comments could help her!

## Code style

When naming variables use strict camel case e.g. use myUrl not myURL. This is so we can automatically convert from camelCase to snake_case for JSON output.


## Issues

If would like to report an issue or suggest any kind of improvement please use Github Issues.
