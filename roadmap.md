# Welcome to the OBP roadmap!

This document contains

* Current developments
* A link to [completed_developments](completed_developments.md)
* The future (as much as anyone can know!) 

Our roadmap is agile and likely to be modified / re-prioritised based on demand from banks and developers. It should be seen as an indication of direction rather than something set in stone.

This document mainly concerns OBP API but may reference other OBP projects.

If you have a particular requirement or would like to comment or help us specify, please [get in touch](http://www.openbankproject.com/contact) or make a pull request to this document.
