# Welcome to the OBP roadmap!

This document contains

* Upcoming developments
* Completed developments (most recent first)
* The future (as much as anyone can know!) 

Our roadmap is agile and likely to be modified / re-prioritised based on demand from banks and developers. It should be seen as an indication of direction rather than something set in stone. 

This document mainly concerns OBP API but may reference other OBP projects.

If you have a particular requirement or would like to comment or help us specify, please [get in touch](http://www.openbankproject.com/contact) or make a pull request to this document.



## Current developments

### Enhanced support for Berlin Group, STET, UK Open Banking and Polish APIs


## Completed developments (most recent first)

### Web Hooks (on balance change etc.)


### Message Docs
Message Docs (which define Core Banking System Kafka messages) are now avilalbe independent of the connector being used on the API instance. See [here](https://apiexplorersandbox.openbankproject.com/?ignoredefcat=true&tags=#v2_2_0-getMessageDocs) 

### Endpoint config and cleanup
Endpoints can now be enabled / disabled explicitly using Props file.
We removed old versions including v1.0, v1.1 and v.1.2.

### API Explorer UI improved
Left panel of API Explorer is now grouped by API Tags.

### Automated performance tests
We added automated performance tests driven by Jenkins.


### Performance improvements
We added "new style" endpoints and acheived some significant performance gains by using Futures and purer (no read side effects) functions.


### Custom code folders in OBP-API
We added Custom code folders so that bank specific forks can more easily git merge in updates from OBP-API develop branches. 


### API Tester
API Tester is a Python/Djano App for testing an OBP API instance from the outside. Partiularly useful when using a non-sandbox (e.g. kafka) connector. It supports a variety of authentication methods so you can test outside a gateway. You can configure different data profiles for specifying parameters such as bank_id, account_id etc. See [here](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/API-Tester) for the source code and installation instructions.

### Extend Swagger support 
We improved the information contained in the Swagger (and Resource Doc) endpoints. They are also available from the API Explorer. See [here](https://apiexplorersandbox.openbankproject.com/?ignoredefcat=true&tags=#v1_4_0-getResourceDocsSwagger)


### Kafka versioning
The built in kafka connectors now provide message versioning 

### Akka Remote data (Three tier architechture)
Most OBP data access now happens over Akka. This allows the API layer to be physically separated from the storage layer with the API layer only able to call a specified set of data access functions with only the storage layer having JDBC / SQL access.    

### Security improvements

Including

* User lockout
* Consumer redirect lockdown

### User model refactoring
The two user models are now called AuthUser and ResourceUser

### API Manager
