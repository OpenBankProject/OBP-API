#this is needed for oauth to work. it's important to access the api over this url, e.g.
# if this is 127.0.0.1 don't use localhost to access it.
# (this needs to be an URL)
# --for tests don't set it to 127.0.0.1, for some reason
hostname=http://localhost:8016

#this is only useful for running the api locally via RunWebApp
#if you use it, make sure this matches your hostname port!
#if you want to change the port when running via the command line, use "mvn -Djetty.port=8089 jetty:run" instead
tests.port=8016
