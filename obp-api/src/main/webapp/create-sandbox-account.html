		This form is designed to allow developers to create test accounts. When an account is created,
		a view with VIEW_ID "owner" will be created, and access to this view will be granted to the user
		(you) who created it. If you wish, you may then populate the account with transactions using the
		<a href="https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/REST-API-V1.2.1#payments">v1.2.1 payments API</a>.
		If you wish to do this, you will probably want to create some other accounts to send payments to and receive
		payments from.
